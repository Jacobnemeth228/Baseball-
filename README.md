My plan is to implement a baseball tracker that is able to track past stats and logs future stats 
using historical and current data.
  Types of stats being tracked
    Batting average
    ERA
    OPS
    OBP
 and many more. 
 I am implementing this project in python as it easily supports many packages and the data will be easy to extract.
